# Analog Clock Web Project

This is a responsive analog clock web project built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The clock displays the current time with moving hour, minute, and second hands on a traditional clock face featuring Roman numerals.

## Features

- Real-time clock animation with smooth rotating hands
- Roman numeral clock face design for classic style
- Ticking sound plays every second for a realistic feel
- Responsive layout using CSS viewport units for different screen sizes
- Clear and modern design with contrasting colors

## How It Works

JavaScript fetches the current system time every second using `Date` object methods. It calculates the rotation angle for each hand based on the time and updates the CSS `transform` property to rotate the hour, minute, and second hands accordingly. A ticking sound plays every second via an audio element.

## Technologies Used

- HTML5 for structure
- CSS3 for styling and responsive design
- JavaScript for dynamic time functions and animations
- Audio API to play the ticking sound

## How to Use

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Open the `index.html` file in any modern web browser.
3. Enjoy the functioning analog clock with ticking sound.
